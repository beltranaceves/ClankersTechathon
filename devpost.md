## Inspiration
Seeing the monumental Runestone, birth certificate of Denmark and centerpiece of the museum and it's 3d restored counterpart we wanted to render possible living both experiences at the same time.

## What it does
We are using AR markers to project in the real world a 3D model we made mimicking the model we saw at the museum showcase. Used to overlap the real one to show how it was

## How we built it
We built it using Aframe, cloudfare, Astro and AR.JS

## Challenges we ran into
At first the model was not loading correctly, we could not get the model to show in the AR, then we had problems with the tracking of the position in 3D space. And in the end we had a bit of trouble in regulating the text boxes to be able to read information in the 3d model

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to recreate the 3D model and show it in AR, we brainstormed different ideas and came up with one that can be used not only for the current scope but also for different other circumstances.

## What we learned
We learned how to use AR.JS, and A-frame, we learned how to brainstorm and conclude work rapidly.

## What's next for AR Jelling Runestone
Using it for other use cases like showing images and models at Yggdrasil's runes, with additional information regarding these creatures and places. Also to be able to use it to see rooms, houses, fields etc, how they used to look like and how would the day to day life look like
